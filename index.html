                    <p>Nestled on West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, Togo is a slender sliver of a nation boasting a remarkable diversity of landscapes compressed into its narrow borders. From palm-fringed beaches along the coast, it stretches north through rolling hills and plateaus to the arid plains of the Sahel. Known for its vibrant markets, like the famed Akodessewa Fetish Market in the capital city of Lomé, Togo is a country rich in Voodoo culture and tradition, offering a compelling blend of ancient customs and modern African life</p>
